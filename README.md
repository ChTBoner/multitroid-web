# [multitroid](http://multitroid.com) web client
Super Metroid co-op frontend.

## Local development
```sh
npm install
npm start
```

This will run the application on [localhost port 8092](http://localhost:8092).

By default the web client will make sessions on [the running beta version](http://beta.multitroid.com) backend. 
If you need to run the client against a local/different backend, you can change the proxy URL in the bottom
of [webpack.dev.js](webpack.dev.js).

## Deployment
Deployment is not currently set up for the open source repo, so we'll handle it manually.
